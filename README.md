# homeFW
Home FW is a project that may be subject to several iteractions

## 1st iteration - RJ45 wire tap connected to a computer
This iteration of the project  holds several parts:
* RJ 45 Wire tap
* Suricata

### RJ 45 Wire tap

### Suricata

### Results
...
#### Good
...
#### Bad
...

## 2nd iteration - DNS filtering with Pi-Hole
This iteration of the project holds several parts:
* install PiHole in a RaspberyPi
* Configure DNS in the home APs

### PiHole
...
### configuring DNS
...
### Results

#### Good

#### Bad

## 3rd iteration - Detect Wifi attacks with Kismet
This iteration of the project is just about installing Kismet
### Kismet
...
### Results
...
#### Good

#### Bad

## 4th iteration - collect logs into Splunk
This iteration of the project holds several parts:
* install Splunk
* collect logs from local server
* collect logs from home ssh server
* push alarms to Slack
* push alarms to MQTT
* collect logs from home web server
### Splunk
...
### Splunk to Slack
...
In Splunk, configure the alert, add actions and select the "Slack" add-on, select the channel and configure the message:
![pic](suricata_alarm_config_1.png)
I got the scheduled alarms in my Slack for mobile: 
![pic](splunk_to_slack_alarm_mobile_1.png).

However, the message is not populated as I expected. The link also fails because the link refers the machine local name.

Should be easy with the Splunk Universal forwarder, as explained here https://ethicalhackingguru.com/put-splunk-universal-forwarder-on-raspberry-pi/ or here https://community.splunk.com/t5/Getting-Data-In/Universal-Forwarder-on-Raspberry-Pi/m-p/58046. However, seems it is no longer supported. I've tried the officall versions available  at https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html, but they seemed not to work. Splunk also details how to install, but the link does not work at all: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/industries/how-to-splunk-data-from-a-raspberry-pi-three-easy-steps.html.

So I've tried the solution with syslog. 

#### Syslog receiver in Splunk
...
#### Syslog sending from RPi to Splunk
Quite easy task, this is a good guide: https://rubysash.com/operating-system/linux/setup-rsyslog-client-forwarder-on-raspberry-pi/
Install rsyslog, and configure the IP of splunk:
```
sudo apt-get purge rsyslog
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
...
auth,authpriv.*                 /var/log/auth.log
*.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
daemon.*                        -/var/log/daemon.log
kern.*                          -/var/log/kern.log
lpr.*                           -/var/log/lpr.log
mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log
user.*                          -/var/log/user.log
...
*.* @@192.168.1.151
```
You can leave as default. The above link also provides easy ways to troubleshoot:
```
# service
sudo systemctl status rsyslog.service
# tcp dump
sudo tcpdump -nnei any port 514

```

#### Dashboard in Splunk
Created the new searches and saved to the RPI4 dashboard:
* city of the IP of the invalid usernames: source="tcp:514" "Invalid user"  | rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>[[ipv4]])" | iplocation src_ip | stats count by City  | sort -count
* invalid usernames: source="tcp:514" "Invalid user"  | rex field=_raw "(?<src_ip>ipv4)"  | rex "(Invalid user )(?<InvUser>\w+)" | stats count by InvUser | sort -count
* failed authentiction: source="tcp:514" "authentication failure" "user=" | rex "(user=)(?<UnauthUser>\w+)" | stats count by UnauthUser | sort -count
And I was able to create a dashboard with ssh attacks to the RPi:

##  5th iteration - reduce ssh attacks with fail2ban
fail2ban is a simple tool that by analyzing logs, discovers repeated failed authentication attempts and automatically sets firewall rules to drop traffic originating from the offenderâ€™s IP address.
More info here: https://blog.swmansion.com/limiting-failed-ssh-login-attempts-with-fail2ban-7da15a2313b
### fail2ban
Install and use the default config: ```sudo apt install fail2ban```
Checking installation:
```
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
Status for the jail: sshd
