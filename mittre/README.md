# MITTRE ATTACK analysis

# **Iteration 1**
This first iteration is based on the status where there were some exposed services.

| Tactics	| Techniques | Sub-tech	| Attack details	| Results	| Mitigations	| Detection	| Issues | Future actions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Reconnaissance TA0043	| Active Scanning	T1595	| Scanning IP Blocks 0.001	| connected via a mobile phone to get an externl IP ping home.pires.xyz results the 2.80.44.128 sudo nmap -sV | IP is 2.80.44.128 sudo nmap -sV home.rpires.xyz DNS record for 2.80.44.128: bl19-44-128.dsl.telepac.pt PORT     STATE  SERVICE  VERSION 80/tcp   open   http     lighttpd 1.4.69  113/tcp  closed ident 443/tcp  closed https  1883/tcp open mqtt 8000/tcp open   ssl/http Splunkd httpd |	M1056        Pre-compromise  detect and block uncommon data flows| My temporary IP is 87.196.80.59, which can be found at a webservice such as https://whatismyipaddress.com/.

Some analysis around the web raises some paths for an attack: - 80/lighttpd 1.4.69, no vulnerabilities found https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=lighttpd - 1883/mqtt, no vulnerabilities found. However a quick test confirms that mqtt is not secured. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/1883-pentesting-mqtt-mosquitto - 8000/splunk: possibly unhautenticated, confirmed with accessing via a browser to https://home.rpires.xyz:8000/en-US/app/launcher/home. Authentication GUI is restricted to paid licenses. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/8089-splunkd | M1042        Disable or Remove Feature or Program M1056        Pre-compromise activate authentication on splunk activate authentiction and encryption in mqtt service |	DS0029        Network Traffic not detected |	mqtt server is not secured. splunk server may be compromised by a malicious actor by analyzing the logs and installing apps. One specific app may provide reverse shell | enable authentication on splunk enable authentiction and encryption in mqtt service |
